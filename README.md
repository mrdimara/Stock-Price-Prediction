## Introduction
Stock market price prediction is a time series forecasting problem. In this project, we leverage TensorFlow's deep learning capabilities to build an RNN-based model to predict stock prices. The implementation is designed to demonstrate the use of Python libraries and TensorFlow to handle and analyze time-series data effectively.

## Libraries Used
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis in a tabular format.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical computations and array-based operations efficiently.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization to understand trends and correlations.
- **TensorFlow**: To create and train a Recurrent Neural Network for time-series forecasting.

## Features
- Load and preprocess historical stock market data.
- Visualize data trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Build and train a Recurrent Neural Network using TensorFlow.
- Predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be sourced from any stock market data provider, such as Yahoo Finance or Kaggle. Ensure the data contains features like `Date`, `Open`, `Close`, `High`, and `Low`.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
